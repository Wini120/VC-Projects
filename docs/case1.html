    <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>


<p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was 
born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of 
mathematics, <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most 
prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over <em>800 different books and 
papers</em>. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.</p>

<p>is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's 
work, <cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748)</cite>, remained a standard textbook in the field for 
well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote 
<cite>Lettres à une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772)</cite>, giving a clear 
non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the 
time.</p> 

<p> can hardly write a mathematical equation without copying Euler. 
Notations still in use today, such as <var>e</var> π and , were introduced 
in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind 
a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals 
of mathematics.</p>

<h1>The Most Beautiful Theorem?</h1>

<p>Euler's Equation</p>

<p>cos(<var>x</var>) + <var>i</var>sin(x) = <var>e</var> <sup>(ix)</sup></p>

<p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, 
and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive
the identity</p>

<p><var>e</var><sup>(π <var>i</var>)</sup> + 1 = 0</p>

<p>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, π, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in
a single beautiful and elegant statement. A poll of readers 
conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite> magazine named 
Euler's Identity as the 
most beautiful theorem in the history of mathematics.
